## Indicators of Attack (IoA)
### Definition:
Signs that an attack is in progress or about to happen.
Purpose: Helps detect and stop the attack before it causes damage.

### Examples (Common IoA):

Unusual outbound traffic

Sudden spikes in failed login attempts

Unexpected use of admin privileges

Changes in critical configuration files

Suspicious process execution

Large data transfers to unknown destinations

## Indicators of Compromise (IoC)
### Definition:
Evidence that a system has already been breached or compromised.
Purpose: Helps investigate the scope and impact of a security incident.

### Examples (Common IoC):

Malware signatures found in files

Presence of backdoor or rootkit

Unexpected system reboots or crashes

Unusual file changes or deletion

Log entries showing unauthorized access

Communication with known malicious IPs/domains

## Difference Between IoA and IoC

### IoA ----------------------------------------	IoC

Attack is happening or about to happen -------------	Attack already happened

Predictive & proactive ----------------------------------	Reactive & investigative

Used for prevention ------------------------------------	Used for forensics & response

## Incident Response Plan (IRP)
**Definition:**
A structured approach for detecting, responding to, and recovering from security incidents.

### Phases (NIST model):

**Preparation** – Develop policies, tools, and training.

**Detection & Analysis** – Identify and verify the incident.

**Containment** – Limit the spread of the attack.

**Eradication** – Remove the threat (e.g., delete malware).

**Recovery** – Restore systems to normal operation.

**Lessons Learned** – Review incident, update policies, improve defenses.

##  IoA – IoC – Incident Response Plan summary table inUrdu only :

**Indicators of Attack (IoA)**	Wo signs jo dikhate hain ke attack chal raha hai ya shuru hone wala hai.

**Common IoA**	Ghair mamooli outbound traffic, bohot zyada failed logins, admin privileges ka achanak use, critical file configs ka badalna, suspicious processes chalna, unknown destinations pe large data transfer.

**Indicators of Compromise (IoC)**	Wo saboot jo dikhate hain ke system pehle hi compromise ho chuka hai.

**Common IoC**	Malware signatures ka milna, backdoor/rootkit ka hona, system ka achanak restart/crash hona, file changes/deletion, unauthorized access ke log entries, malicious IP/domain se communication.

**IoA vs IoC**

**IoA** – Attack ho raha hai ya hone wala hai (prevention).
**IoC** – Attack ho chuka hai (investigation).

**Incident Response Plan (IRP)**
Security incident ko detect, respond aur recover karne ka structured plan.

**IRP Phases**

1. Preparation – Policy, tools, training tayar karna.
2. Detection & Analysis – Incident identify aur verify karna.
3. Containment – Attack ka spread rokna.
4. Eradication – Threat ko remove karna.
5. Recovery – Systems normal operation me lana.
6. Lessons Learned – Review karke policies aur defenses improve karna.
